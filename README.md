# MOVIE_GENRE_CLASSIFICATION
# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify movies into their respective genres based on their plots, descriptions, or other relevant features. The goal is to create a system that can accurately predict the genre of a movie, enabling users to discover new movies that match their interests.

# Key Features
Data Collection: A dataset of movies with their corresponding genres and plots/descriptions is collected and preprocessed for training the model.
Model Development: A machine learning model is developed and trained using the collected dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between movie features and genres.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.

# Technical Details
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Library: Numpy,Pandas,Sklearn,LogisticRegression
Dataset: A collection of movie data from sources such as IMDB.
